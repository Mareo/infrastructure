# If bugs are found â€“ check that repository
# Since Gentoo builds from source, to save time on molecule tests, we should reuse artifacts as much as possible
# This playbook performs the initial setup of a Gentoo container
# It configures portage to try to use prebuilt packages if available and to save the built packages.
